# ELECTRO SOUNDS -2- PROPOSAL

### Project Title: THRU

###  Description

For my project I'd like to focus on a realtime animation that focuses on evolving shapes in a 3D terrain. I would like to explore the idea of a 'custom shaped super object attractor' that evolves over time with a sound track as different parameters of the shape react to different frequencies.The object moves through a 3D field.

###  Methodology

The creation process of this animation will take part in a series of different sketches that will eventually combine into one main sketch.

The first sketch will be making use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to animate certain parameters of a shape by allocating specific frequency spectrums to certain parameters of the shape.

The second sketch will dive deeper into superformula and super shape making in a 3D field.

The third sketch will focus on moving through a 3D field of objects and shifting my way through the animation with the arrow keys of the keyboard.

For final touches to the sketch, the use of a midi controller will also add to changing parameters on the go to add depth and variations to the animation. I aim to assign knobs to send out numbers to change other variables in my sketch.

###  Visual sketches (drawings; visual impression of your project)

I have used a very rough drawing to visualize my project but also have images from some artist inspirations as examples to the visual aesthetic I will be going for in this project.

###  Sound track details (genre, sound aesthetics)

The genre for the sound track will be electronic, focusing on short tones and percussive hits. The main sound generating tools I am going to use are completely analog (eg. Moog Voyager, MakeNoise, Korg MS-20). The aim for the track is to use the frequency spectrum sparsely, so as to enable the fast fourier transform to showcase its ability to separate different frequencies.
